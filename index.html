<p class="hue" style="font: 50%" onclick="shizIsBlack()">&bull; It's a joy for me and for all of us who want to see you celebrating another year, my friend. &bull;</p>
<p class="hue" style="font: 50%" onclick="shizIsWhite()">&bull; No matter where life takes us to, I will always be there for you, because we always stick together and never leave each other. No matter what obstacles life may throw at us, we will always overcome it all, because two is always better than one. And you plus me equals an unbeatable and unstoppable team. I cherish you so much, my dear Boo!. &bull;</p>


<p class="hue" style="font: 50%" onclick="shizIsBlack()">&bull; You are more than a friend. You’re my sister, my partner-in-crime, my other half. You know me better than I know myself. You know what I like, what I love, what I hate. You applaud my passions and tolerate my faults. You’re there for me, always. And it’s not always about what we say, or what we do – because you, by yourself, is enough. You, with your smile, your laugh, your friendship – it’s more than I deserve. We’ve laughed, we’ve cried, and we’re stronger than ever. Because there’s no me without you. You’re part of me – part of me, my life, my family, my entire world. &bull;</a></p>

<p class="hue" style="font: 50%" onclick="shizIsWhite()">&bull;Certain things happen in a certain way at a certain time and place for a certain reason. And sometimes, God brings certain people into our lives for a purpose, but whatever reasons He had in mind for making our path cross and bringing us together, I don’t really care, because I’m honored and grateful that He did. I love you always, my dear Butty! &bull;</p>
